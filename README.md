## Challenge Summary
This Election Analysis script could be easily modified to support the election commission or specific campaigns in the future. With the addition of the total registered voters per county, the election commision could use this code with small modification to identify voter turnout percentages per county (total votes / total registered voters). This could support the election commission in making decisions on where to expend resources like improved advertising or more polling stations to increase voter turnout.

Specific campaigns could best utilize this script by identifying a candidate breakdown per county. This would allow candidates to understand where they could best expend their campaign energy. This would be even better utilized with a set of polling data that included which county the voter lived in and who they intended to vote for in an upcoming election.
